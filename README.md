A course visualization, organization, and assessment system.

This system organizes classroom learning as a directed acyclic graph. The graph nodes represent course topics and the edges represent relationships between topics. Students earn a competency grade for each topic, and the topic grades determine the overall course grade.

Each topic can have one quiz which consists of multiple choice, select all, and parsons coding problems. Students receive instant feedback on their question submissions and may exit the quiz as soon as they reach a satisfactory quiz grade.
