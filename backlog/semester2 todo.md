# Questions

- Uploading graded assignments??

# Notes from Floryan
Good progress, but still some significant things to accomplish here.

Major Things:

- How is the % complete calculated? It is neither showed to the student nor evident to me. At a minimum, a student must be able to see how those numbers were generated. It should be one of the tabs when I click on a topic. Something like "score" and you can see a summary of everything that contributed to that percentage. - Are the current percentages dummy values? Or am I seeing class averages because I am the instructor? - Along those lines...can I get a dummy student account to see the student side?

* I would still like to see a way for me to manually tweak how the percentages are calculated. The more flexible the better.

* We still want to add the ability for me to see individual student information.

* In the graph editor, I need to be able to delete nodes and edges. - e.g., there are a bunch of nodes that say "Farid's Notes" in the bottom right of the graph.

* I need to be able to upload test/hw grades into the graph. The csv format can be something like studentId, source (e.g., midterm 2), sub-source (e.g., question 5 but could be NULL), grade, weight, etc. and this would just fill the student's graphs with a bunch of grades (and appear on the "score" tab as noted above.)

Minor Things:

- Says "Hello Professor Floryan" before I even login.
- When coming back to the site (still logged in) there is a "login" button in the upper right instead of the logout button, etc.
- When I add a URL for a resource, your system adds the https://www. in front of it. I don't want that. Just take what I type in exactly please.
- I got stuck editing the graph at one point. Clicked "upload csv", cancelled the upload and button changed to save and submit. Then I couldn't do anything. Had to refresh back to home.
