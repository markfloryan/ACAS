There is currently a "DSA1" class loaded into the system in which these users are students.
Inside this class, you all can
- View the course graph
- View topic competencies
- View the course grade
- Click a topic and view resources
- Take a quiz (for arrays)
- View your grade

These accounts are also enabled as professors, so they can create classes of their own.
To test a new class, please follow these steps:
- Click Create Class
- Name the class whatever you would like
- Create two nodes named "Arrays" and "Linked List"
- These nodes must be named exactly "Arrays" and "Linked List" since our CSVs expect these names
- Save the class graph
- Download the csv real world examples from https://github.com/uva-cp-1920/Student-Performance-Tracker/tree/master/csv/real_world
- Click CSV
- Upload the course roster
- You can check the roster page to view the students
- Go back to the CSV page to upload assignments
- Upload assignment grades
- You can now check the "Arrays" topic to view the grades
- Go back to CVS and click the "Arrays Quiz", select the arrays_quiz.csv, and upload the quiz
- You should now be able to take the quiz in the "Arrays" topic
- As a professor, you can also edit student grades
- Go to Arrays topic settings and lock and unlock topics
- You can view student grades
- You can also add or remove resources
