## Introduction/ELI5:

- We’re working on a student learning tool that needs access to collab so student progress on the tool can update student grades on collab
- Goals:
  - Get access to collab resources/tools for SPT
  - Specifically “Gradbook Classics,” “Resources,” and “Tests & Quizzes”

## Questions:

- Will we be using an API or just hitting EP’s

## Uses of collab:

- Gradbook Classics (importing/exporting):
  - Retrieve Grade (exporting grades)
  - Update Grades (importing grades)
- Resources (exporting)
  - Take resources folders and allows our site to use files (exporting)
- Tests & Quizzes (importing/exporting)
  - If student takes quiz on collab, the results will be exported to our site (exporting)
  - Student can take quiz on our site (exporting) and the results go back to collab (importing)

## Challenges:

- Need privileged access
- API
  - Updating grades
    - Not true proper api but managable

      - Grades specifically: https://collab.its.virginia.edu/direct/grades/describe
      - Sakai grading entity broker
    - https://collab.its.virginia.edu/direct/membership/describe
  - Establishing a session
    - session: https://collab.its.virginia.edu/direct/session/describe
    - JSESSIONID cookie
    - OR ?sakai.session=<sessionId>
