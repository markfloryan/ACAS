Main Focus: Login email with gmail and work on collab linking (come back with list of what we found for next sprint)
    - Create something that is more CSV and then convert it to JSON (more for giving to other professors)



Graph:
    - Allow capability of instructors looking at graph of a class (2150) over the course of multiple sememesters '
        - You will have to deal with if course changes (inquire again at sprint4)
    - Floryan Prefers rectangles and pointing arrows
    - A node is "unlocked" as long as the node before it is greater than 0%
    - Display the whole graph to students so that they can see where they are going
    - Allow instructors to duplicate a class (topics, graph, and resouces) rather than cool construction tool

Testing 
    - Floryan also wants to show how grades are calculated (in reference to the wireframe)
    - Allow testing to be external (plug in via API)
        - Collab: Allow professors to have to do least amount of work  (ex. type in url)
    - Collab API (sikai) was used in TPegs â†’ Aaron Bloomfield might know
        - Grade Book
        - Tests & Quizzes

Instructor Account:
    - Floryan made us fake useer accounts with fake tests and grades

Gmail 
    - (any gmail email) + (internal list of course emails) = login
    - If someone has a valid gmail email but not on course list have a default page view


Eventually:
    - Easy check box for using different external tools
