Did a demo of Aiden's work

# ToDo

- Change uploading to be a CSV file with headers instead of current way
    - Cares more about the grade uploads than the course upload
- Main concern is simply pulling in the grades

  - Okay with downloading the grades and putting in "awful csv format" then uploading to thing
  - wants a list of steps that would be needed to get it into our system
    - Maybe show a JSON of what to do?

- Better grade tool

- Grades
    - Weighted sum of nodes
        - Each child node of the main node has a weight, must add to 1
        - includes the node that we are on
