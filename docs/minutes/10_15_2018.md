Meeting Minutes with Floryan- 10/15/2018

Login-> 
	handle not having any classes by having an empty screen (sorry)
	usernames uploaded by text file, create instance to show up for each user in that roster.
	Class and semester should be different fields, so store semesters.
	aggregate data accross classes by year/ by semester (define global nodes for aggregation purpose)
	use our own list of users instead of collab integration.
	Look into collab integration specifically. (in the next couple sprints, how easy is collab use/ integration).
	(hit collab, get data back, display data (collab gradebook/tests/quizzes)).
	Collab = sakai
Graph-> 
	need grading information inside node.
	could become unlocked before there is a grade 
	should be able to see all nodes, block out ones that are too advanced somehow.
	Use outside quiz systems utilizing API's instead of building a quiz-based system.
	Base level quiz integration-> link to collab with some configurations.
Adding Class-> 
	maybe convert CSV to json (JSON is too hard for some people to create)
	Stretch GOAL -> drag and drop based graph creation. (don't want to regenerate graph each time)
	Duplicate graph->important (willing to invest time initially to create graph).
