# First Meeting with Floryan of Semester 2

**His last big request is grading as a function of the past nodes**

- Even if it is simple
- Only a function of its direct nodes
- Thinks that showing them the formula for the grade and where it came from might be a good way to have the explaination of where it came from / how it is done√é

## General

- Need to be able to go from external API and map it into the graph

  - Okay with going though each individual question
    - Just not every semester
    - One time set-up
  - Have a marking that it is from an external source
    - Just to have as a reference

- Really wants to have TPEGS and the course website
  - THIS IS A MUST HAVE more or less
  - He can give us more information
  - Wants to be able to upload a method and our code will know how to run it
    - Black box system that as long as it can return data in a certain for then it will work

### Grading

- Need to have topic grades influence future nodes
  - Have past topic grades have an influence in future grades
    - Wants to have all topics unlocked and watch the progress propgrate through
    - Inheritance
  - Let the code break if there is a loop
  - Think of the grade as a probability of the past node
    - Bays theorem
- We need to have some way to incooprate the quizzes into the grading system
- Have triggers for when to update the grades
- Have a way to input test grades into a node and have them

### Uploading

- As long as he can upload everything then he is okay
  - even if it manual and he can use it
