Generic Client Takeaways
	- Really wants quizzes by the end of the academic year. Preferably by at least the later half of the semester.
	- Grades should be percentile based or cutoff based per course.

Grades
	- External HW/grades
		- Percentile
	- Instructors who want traditional grading should be capable of doing that.
	- Set threshold or percentile per course based on professor preference
	- Assignments
	- Topics have default mode
Build out large sample data sets to stress test system 


Quizzes
	- Can start development
Quizzes should have minimum requirements done by next semester (hopefully)

Assignments
	- Take-home programming assignments
	- Student
		- Doesn’t turn it in in our system
	- Professor/TA
		- Our system receives grades from outside source.
	- 2 possible ways to get them in
		- Upload grades from Collab .csv HIGH PRIORITY
		- Other course 
		- Collab format
For assignment mappings, if the professor doesn’t create the relations to topics, is it possible to have them just manually map to topic during the upload?

TAs exist in models
TA frontend support will be a subset of professor
	- No front end for that
	- Priorities for TA
		- Log in as TA
		- Have fewer permissions than Professor
		- Read permissions, no write permissions
