1. Epic 1 (Security) notes- need to include a story re:students not having access to everything, but professors having access to everything
2. Epic 2 (Syllabus) notes- break it down more, but 2.3 and 2.4 are pretty good (use these as an example?)
	1. 2.1 might not be necessary at all
	2. 2.2 could be converting class grades to Pass/Fail (or starting a pass/fail toggle)
	3. May need to integrate a competency score framework too
	4. Epic 2 is really good to have functionality in the Spring-- consider working on this in Oct/Nov?
3. Epic 3 (Refactor) notes- shoot for 1000- CS 2110 has 885 this year
	1. It’d be nice to refactor stuff- takes 3 minutes to load a graph rn with 2150 data
		1. Especially because it tends to pull everything whenever you load a page, and that’s pretty inefficient
		2. Need to be sure we aren’t pulling all the data for the whole class, when just one student is logged in
		3. Every component is doing their own fetch- could fix that and reuse data
		4. Could add refresh/refetch buttons all over the place if consistency goes down
	2. Would be nice to know how long it’d take to load a lot of data at once
	3. Could have some overlap with Epic 1- can’t pull data you don’t have access to
4. Epic 4 (Features) notes- probably the last in line to be implemented (Spring or earlier)
	1. Quiz- answer questions for the next x minutes, pull from a 50-100 strong pool
		1. Grading isn’t necessarily important right now
	2. DSA II will probably not have the same quizzes, so feature might have a destination for next fall
	3. Different module sizes would be good to handle- do we already have that?
	4. Need to facilitate submissions for short answer / long answer (in pool)
		1. Also have the mechanic where a grader can go through and read ‘em
	5. When a quiz is created, can specify which types of questions (M.C., short answer, Parson’s, etc)
	6. Pool is related to topic, questions have a data type which says which type of question they have, and while making a quiz you can choose the combinations of questions
	7. All non-short answer questions should get instant feedback after submission (need a “pending” thing)
		1. Need a random grading interface like the Kytos quiz comments grading
		2. Be sure we are always having the same question each time
	8. You are certainly allowed to find a piece of software that already does all this stuff, as long as you can hook it into the thing and set up an account on the site that uses that service.
		1. As long as we can access the data, then we’re good, but if you want to just outsource the quiz-making you can do that too
	9. Thing that would be cool: submit homework/code for autograde on this system
5. Servers!
	1. We can put our product on Floryan’s servers but you have to be on the VPN
	2. Floryan says put the demo of the product on the server we’re given
	3. Floryan will take a look at his server, but there are no guarantees
		1. We could probably host the develop servers outside of UVA
		2. Or we could always do dev as localhost
		3. Or we could do dev and prod on the same servers
		4. Floryan says setting up his servers will take too long
1. Priorities:
	1. Epic 1 is first for sure
		1. (shouldn’t take very long, hopefully) (Floryan has fixed it once, we just need to put his solution everywhere)
	2. Most of them are in order by priority, but also Epic 4 is really exciting for Floryan
	3. You can half-fix Epic 3 if you’re going to be able to get quizzes in before the end of the semester.
1. Floyran notes:
	1. He’s made a getting started guide- we can use that once he sends it to us
