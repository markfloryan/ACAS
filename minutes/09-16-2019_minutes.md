1. Secure site:

Currently can ping the server and get grades; shore up api and security; examine the endpoints
Currently uses Google api - OAuth
Frontend needs to hold a token
Security testing

2. Has to match up with current way pilot is being executed (grading system):

https://markfloryan.github.io/dsa1/courseLogistics/syllabus.html
For Data Structures and Algorithms 1
Read the syllabus and match the app to the stuff
Grading in particular is rough at the moment; make the grading schemes match
Final grade based on stair step of pass/incompetence (3 states of users - incompetence, some competence, mastery)
Display only a certain number of nodes at a time - only the  ones you’ve ‘unlocked’ so far - nodes unlock like a skill/tech tree

3. Stress Testing

Has to handle large amounts of grades at once (how big is a max file?)
Scalability adjustments
Don’t load everything at once plz.
Cache stuff?
Efficiency improvements
