Questions for Floryan:
For total course competency, is it sufficient to simply configure a number of topics for some competency and a number of topics for total competency?


For topics, is it sufficient to simply specify a weight for each assignment? This used to be done with categories.


There used to be a system taking into account ancestor weights? Is this still important?
