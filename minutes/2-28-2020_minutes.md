Meeting Notes for Floryan

Questions/Queries/Quandaries/Quadratics/Quails/Quizzations/Quiet/Quickly/Q(ue)*/Cue:
We’ve added Corey to the front end for Quiz api to help get that running smoothly. Will definitely be done within two sprints. 
Connor is working on making sure you can customize how grades are assigned
We have a requirement of covering the codebase with tests, and on the frontend the previous team ignored it and only reported backend coverage, so Jimmy and Taylor are working on bringing the code coverage up
Andrew fixed the add/remove student feature and is now adding pagination to it so that it scales
Corey made the feature to add student grades and is finishing up the functionality to update/delete grades
Jack is finishing up progress on the CSV quiz upload and will be incorporating Carrington’s code as the frontend is developed.
Alex is working on customized toast messages

Notes:
Switch api to take questions individually and give feedback and see updated grade on each question. Let them stop the quiz early if they hit a certain percentage early. No need to store each question.
Ability to tweak quiz model parameters would be nice to add to backend
